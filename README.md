# Profile Website

Welcome to my profile website, athletes

Since you're here, you might be:

- Jaiden Martin( Jaiden is an upcoming freshman and he's interested in trying out for the football team this fall. He's about 5'10, 160 lbs, a fast athlete and he's pretty confident that he'll make the team. He's looking for cleats and other protective accessories that he's going to need for the season.)

- [ ] Jaiden is hoping to find cleats and gloves that'll help support him. 
 
- Jonas Collins( Jonas is a senior captain on the basketball team and he's excited for his last year due to him suffering an ACL injury on his left knee last season. He's 6'5, 190 lbs, and was an all-stater.

- [ ] Jonas is hoping to find a leg sleeve for his left knee and some ointment.

- Melany Wise( Melany is an upcoming junior and she plays for her volleyball team at her school. She's expected by her teammates and coaches to take on a leadership role and overall a better player. She's about 5'9 and 155 lbs.

-  [ ] Melany is looking for accessories to make her look fashionable and protect her such as knee pads, elbow pads, and headbands

## Design
My message for the website is for athletes to have an easier time finding any proper safety wear and accessories that they need. I will use visual hierarchy by presenting the best-rated products, and most demanded products, utilizing color strategically, and using whitespace. Using whitespace would help create separation to help focus on important elements that I'm trying to advertise better for athletes scrolling through.



## Accessbility 
My website would be accessible to different users by me providing a chat agent that can help speak to someone that might have trouble reading due to dyslexia, a sign language interpreter, voice speech, and a 3d shoe model to help people have a view of how their shoes would look on them.
